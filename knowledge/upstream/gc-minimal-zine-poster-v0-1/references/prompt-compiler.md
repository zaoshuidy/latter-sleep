# Prompt Compiler

Compile only information that can become visible pixels. Prefer one concrete visual decision over several vague aesthetic labels.

## Field Order

Every generation prompt must answer these questions in order:

1. **Canvas:** ratio, paper surface, border/mockup status.
2. **Attention geometry:** negative-space percentage, cluster size, and position.
3. **Input-photo contract, when applicable:** image role, preservation level, concrete invariants or reference traits, permitted changes, and new elements.
4. **Visual metaphor:** the one subject or relation that carries the meaning.
5. **Anchor form:** photo, clipping, silhouette, block, specimen, printed illustration, texture window, typography, or overlapping panels.
6. **Material treatment:** halftone, xerox softness, risograph grain, letterpress bleed, torn or softened edge, scanline, or slight misregistration.
7. **Typography:** one short phrase, optional archive microtext, font family, and spatial behavior.
8. **Color:** exact main hue, material form, and approximate visual share; optional tiny support hue only when needed.
9. **Reproduction and mood:** flat scanned-paper view, light, contrast, and emotional temperature.
10. **Hard avoids:** the shortest relevant anti-identity list.

## Four-paragraph Prompt Shape

1. Canvas + paper + negative space + cluster size and location.
2. Input-photo contract when applicable + visual metaphor + anchor form + material treatment.
3. Typography + exact main hue + chromatic material form and share + print defects.
4. Flat scan mood + relevant avoid list.

Do not recite the field names. Write decisive image directions as four compact paragraphs.

## Prompt Template

```text
Tall vertical [ratio] paper poster, full-frame [paper_tone] aged paper with [paper_texture], no border and no mockup. Keep [negative_space]% as open paper. Place one [cluster_scale]% visual cluster at [position], comfortably away from the edges.

Translate “[theme]” into [one_visual_relation]. Render it as [anchor_form] using [anchor_treatment]. Keep the event isolated and imageable; do not expand it into a full scene.

Use [typography_mode] for the short phrase “[short_text]”, with optional [microtext_role]. Add one unmistakable [exact_hue] anchor as [color_material], occupying about [canvas_color_share]% of the canvas or [cluster_color_share]% of the cluster. Apply [print_defects] without washing out the chromatic ink.

Flat orthographic scanned-paper appearance, matte absorbent surface, diffuse light, low-to-medium contrast, [mood]. Avoid [relevant_avoids].
```

For an edit target or supporting insert, replace the second paragraph with:

```text
Use the supplied image as [edit_target / supporting_insert] with [high / medium] preservation. Keep [preservation_invariants] recognizable. Allow changes only to [permitted_changes], and introduce only [new_poster_elements]. Translate “[theme]” into [one_visual_relation] and stage it as [anchor_form] using [anchor_treatment], without expanding it into a full scene.
```

For a reference image, replace the second paragraph with:

```text
Use the supplied image only as a visual reference for [reference_traits]. Preserve none of its source subject, identity, wording, or exact composition. Create a new [new_subject_and_relation] for “[theme]” and stage it as [anchor_form] using [anchor_treatment] in a clearly different composition, without expanding it into a full scene.
```

## Compilation Rules

- For an article or complex idea, extract one thesis and one visual relation. Do not summarize the article in the picture.
- For an edit target or supporting insert, name the input image role and repeat the preservation invariants in the prompt. Do not rely on a vague instruction such as `keep the subject similar`.
- For High preservation, prefer an original-photo crop, clipping, or printed fragment over redrawing. Do not convert an identifiable person, pet, product, character, or artwork into a silhouette or loose illustration unless the user explicitly permits reinterpretation.
- For a reference image, describe only the visual traits to learn and explicitly require a new subject and composition.
- If the user supplies exact poster text, use it. Otherwise invent one short phrase in the user's language or in concise English when that fits the mood.
- Keep exact readable text short. Treat longer words as texture only when the user does not require accurate reading.
- Describe low contrast or muted grayscale only for paper, photographs, and secondary ink. Preserve saturation in the main color anchor.
- State actual placement and size. Avoid words such as `somewhere`, `minimal`, `nice`, `artistic`, or `balanced` without renderable constraints.
- Use one main hue. A second hue is allowed only as a tiny subordinate mark and never as equal visual weight.
- Choose negative constraints relevant to the selected recipe; do not waste prompt space on an indiscriminate catalogue.
